            <h2 class="SubHeader">Online Influencers</h2>

            <p>
                <span style="margin-left:1em;">We</span> often see online influencers being used for marketing (Arayess, 2017).
                Online influencers are able to easily reach a large audience and because of this they can easily influence people's opinions.
                Many times influencers sell their own products such as hoodies or hats, other times they are trying to market a company's game.
                Online influencers however are not just limited to marketing; they can also have a positive influence on people's mental and physical health.
                This can be seen on many social media platforms with people raising money for someone in need, or bringing awareness to an issue they feel strongly about in hopes of positive change.
                A good example of how social media and influencers can help people they are seen by smoking. 
                Social media, along with other forms of media, have helped bring light to the dangers of smoking and the benefits of healthy eating(Edgerton, 2016).
                It has also helped with more mentally damaging issues such as bullying (Edgerton, 2016).
                Social media has allowed for a platform where many issues can be talked about openly, and influencers have an even greater impact in those conversations which allows for greater change. 
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="SubHeader">Twitch and YouTube</h2>

            <p>
                <span style="margin-left:1em;">Twitch</span> and Youtube are two of the largest platforms online where people can watch their favorite online influencers. 
                Both have their own appeals and respective audiences. 
                Youtube has one billion hours of watch time per day (YouTube, N.D) whereas twitch has around 15 million daily active users (Infographic, 2020). 
                Youtube, in general, allows people to interact with a larger amount of content but less individual creators. 
                Twitch on the other hand allows for more interaction with social influencers but since all content is live, there is less choice than on Youtube. 
                Both platforms do allow for meaningful communities to form, however due to the higher levels of interaction seen on twitch those communities are (in my experience) more active.

            <h2 class="SubHeader">My Goal</h2>

            <p>
                <span style="margin-left:1em;">For</span> my project I wanted to learn more about some influencers or write about them because I feel they deserve more credit/a larger audience. 
                For each creator I will talk about what they have done and why they are important. 
                They do not all have a large following so for one of them I had to use myself as the source since they had no news covering them or even a website (this influencer is QTCinderella). 
                I tried to talk about what each creator has done to improve either their community, the platform they are on or both.
