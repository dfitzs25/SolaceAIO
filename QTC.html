            <h2 class="SubHeader">Who is She?</h2>

            <p>
                <span style="margin-left:1em;">QTCinderella</span> is an online influencer, she predominantly streams on Twitch. 
                She has a much smaller community compared to others which allows her to have more engagement with her audience. 
                Her most popular streams have around 2 - 3 thousand people watching.  
                These more popular streams are either the podcasts she made or her baking streams. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="SubHeader">Twitch</h2>

            <img class="creatorImg" src="assets/AmongUsCake.jpg" alt="A cake in the shape of an Among Us character">            
            <p>
                <span style="margin-left:1em;">Some</span> of QTCinderella's more enjoyed streams are her baking streams. 
                She was a professional baker before begining her twitch career. 
                She worked in a kitchen making cakes which is one reason why her baking streams are some of her most popular content.
                In her baking streams she will either 'show off' by making a very elaborate cake, or she will help her audience in a <span class="italic">Bake-A-Long</span>.
                Both of these streams are something that are unique to her (from what I know). 
                They allow her to easily gain a connection with her audience something that other streams often times find very challenging. 
                She does this by making sure that the people trying to bake a long with her are not falling behind by answering any questions they have. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="margin-left:1em;">QTCinderella</span> has also started two very successful podcasts; <span class="italic">EGirl Rejects</span>  and <span class="italic">Real Housewives of Twitch</span>. 
                Each podcast brings female streamers together to make entertaining content and also to showcase other women on twitch. 
                The EGirl Rejects podcast brings together QTCinderella, JustaMinx, and Kaceytron. 
                This podcast meets every week on Fridays and they either talk or have a game/challenge to complete together. 
                The Real Housewives of Twitch podcast is more popular however I would argue that this is because it brings together more people all with substantial audiences of their own. 
                QTCinderella started both of these podcasts and they have each gained a large following due to their consistent high quality and entertaining content.

            <h2 class="SubHeader">Her Impact</h2>

            <p>
                <span style="margin-left:1em;">Due</span> to her work with other popular female streamers and her own, she has become somewhat of an icon of female empowerment on twitch for some people. 
                Her live streams and podcasts have shown that women can become very popular on twitch even though twitch is mostly male dominated space (Kavanagh, 2020). 
                She also is not afraid of confrontation when it comes to sexism in the twitch community, recently she called out the <a href="https://livestreamfails.com/post/94651">chess community for their double standards </a> to her and other women on twitch. 
                Due to her outreach and followers, she is able to user her influence to make twitch and other online communities better places for herself and other women.
