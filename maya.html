                <h2 class="SubHeader">Background Information</h2>

                <p>
                    <span style="margin-left:1em;">Maya</span> Higa is a conservationist who often appears on twitch to either play games, raise money for charities or show how interesting her line of work can be. 
                    She has a falconry license and many of her streams involve showing her audience large birds and how they can be trained. 
                    Maya has made a podcast called <span class = "italic">Conservation Cast</span> which aims to show the world of conservation to a larger audience (About the Podcast, 2020). 
                    She, through this podcast and her own stream, has raised a large amount of money for both conservation efforts and charities.

                <h2 class="SubHeader">On Twitch</h2>

                <img class="creatorImg" src="assets/mayabird.jpg" alt="Maya Holding a Bird">
                <p>
                    <span style="margin-left:1em;">The</span> Conservation Cast podcast has had nearly 50 episodes so far, each raising money for a different organization. 
                    These organizations range greatly but all relate to conservation in some way; her podcast has raised money to help Rhinos, Eagles, Sharks and even one to help other people get into conservation (About the Podcast, 2020). 
                    This podcast meets every week to an average audience size of 1,333 people, despite the audience being a somewhat small size, Maya's podcast has still managed to raise over $60,000 (About the Podcast, 2020).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span style="margin-left:1em;">Besides</span> this amazing podcast, Maya has done many other great things on twitch. 
                    She has shown her audience how amazing birds of Prey can be and that they should not be something to be feared. 
                    Maya has allowed her fans to even follow her process as she helps save some birds' lives. 
                    Recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a11aueyAUUY&list=LL&index=5&t=27s">she uploaded a video</a> showing how she saved a red tail falcon which was hit by a car, and then attacked by a dog. 
                    This bird could barely lift her head when Maya first started helping her, and by the end of the video the bird was able to be released. 
                    She also has run fundraising events outside of her podcast and through this she has raised over $100,000 (unsure if that number includes the money raised through her podcast) (About Maya, 2020). 
                    Maya does all of this work to help the community understand conservationists and to give them an easy way to help others. 
                </p>
                
                <h2 class="SubHeader">Her Impact</h2>

                <p>
                    <span style="margin-left:1em;">Maya</span> realized during the start of her twitch career that “twitch is an untapped reservoir for doing good” (Asarch, 2019). 
                    By realizing this she has been able to help so many organizations because she believes that people do actually want to do good. 
                    Through her actions she has allowed people to easily help via donations and understanding what conservationists do for animlas and the world overall.
