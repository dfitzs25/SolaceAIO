        <h3>Small text about my computing experience</h3>
        <p>I am a freshman at RIT in the computer exploration program. I have programed for only really one year. That experience is from AP Comp Sci, a class I enjoyed a lot. That class is why I decided to go into the computer exploration program.
        I knew that I wanted to continue to program in my future - but I do not know what exactly I want to do in programming. Through this program I get to experience different types of computing. 
        This class is actually an example on how I get to experience something new. I have had zero experience in html prior to making this homepage. Beyond computing I have a couple of hobbies such as...</p>

            <p> Beyond those hobbies, I also have pets and enjoy movies. My family owns three dogs and technically own a cat too. Two of my families dogs are Eurasires. 
            These dogs are fluffy with curly tails and pointy tails; think about sammies (the big white fluffy dogs) but instead of white kinda buff. The other dog is a bernie's mountain dogs. 
            She is very nice but very stupid as well. Our cat only sometimes hangs around in my house so I do not really enjoy him. 
            I hope that the next cat I get enjoys cuddling because those are the best types of cats. On the topic of movies, I reallyed enjoyed the Harry Potter series. 
            Overall I would say I enjoye most types of movies but I have not seen every genre. I have only seen one horror movie and that was kinda terrible so I did not enjoy it.
            But every other genre is fair game for me to enjoy.</p>
